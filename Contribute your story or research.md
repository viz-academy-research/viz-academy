Viz Academy is building a collaborative knowledge base on **spatial previsualisation** for theatre, live events, and beyond.

This project was initiated by Benjamin Collins in 2025, following access granted **Royal Shakespeare Company** to research the history and future of previsualization practices in theatre, specifically focusing on **Spatial Previsualization** with VR and AR, projecting its impact over the next decade. 

Aside from some internal research documents by Ryan Metcalfe, the rest of the work has relied on publicly available information, and published research on platforms like ResearchGate and ArXiv.

Since publishing Viz Academy, more than one industry pro has reached out, saying something like 'There's more to this. This is old news!' 

We see this as a signal to open the doors to collaborators: if you have a story that builds on, complements or *contradicts* the research and analysis here, we would love to hear from you. We could set up a written or spoken interview and sign off an article together - or you are very welcome to take it in any direction you like!

**Theory, case studies, and cross-industry insights are welcome!**

## The Vision

The idea is to produce a living body of work on this website, that helps stakeholders and practitioners old and new have a lens into the industry, and see what is possible when the ideas of an industry are ambitions, focused and unified. 

Successive versions of Viz Academy will be 'frozen' and made available. You are probably looking at something close to the 'First Edition' - but wouldn't it be fascinating to see if and how it changes over time, from the stories, accounts, to the conclusion. 

## What We're Looking For

We welcome contributions from practitioners, researchers, and technologists working with spatial visualization in pre-production:

- **Case studies** from previs departments or practitioners
- **Technical innovations** and workflow developments
- **Cross-industry applications** and lessons learned (film, games, events, live performance)
- **Historical perspectives** on visualization in pre-production
- **Practitioner testimonies** documenting authentic experiences

## Submission Process

This is a collaborative process, not a traditional submission/review system.

**To contribute:**
1. Email your proposal or draft to [info@viz.academy](mailto:info@viz.academy)
2. Include a brief outline of what you'd like to cover
3. Share your background/credentials in this area
4. Mention any relevant case studies or examples

We'll work together to develop articles that fit seamlessly into the Viz Academy knowledge base.

## Criteria

We're seeking contributions that:

- Are based on **authentic experience and testimony**
- Are **truthful and well-documented**
- Contribute to **the history of visualization in pre-production**
- Help practitioners and stakeholders understand spatial previs applications

*We aim for a reasonable degree of scientific rigour. Part of this research's nature is to be speculative about what is to come, but we aim for complete accuracy when it comes to the facts of what has occurred!*
