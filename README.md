Welcome to Viz Academy. 

This repo mirrors the site https://viz.academy/ , which runs on the Obsidian Publish platform. Throughout, the content uses wikilinks and md link syntax. 

This research work outlines the solution to emerging production challenges in modern theatre, as technology pushes the capabilities - and expectations - of all stakeholders in a production team.

We will make the case to for adoption of the emerging technology of **spatial previsualisation**, or previs, to combat issues surrounding digital platforms and increasing complexity of modern production. 

We will detail the existing use of previs technology in our industry, with ample context including exploration of practices in other sectors, and a projection ahead of the next decade of technology trends.

The aim of this study is to provide theatre professionals with a broad context of where we are, with the hope to encourage ideals of **best practice** moving forward, to maximise this new potential in tech, in the interest of creative teams and of excellence in storytelling.

## Welcome to Spatial Previsualisation.

*We are currently based in the UK and use British spelling for the most part, i.e. 'previsualisation'. However, 'previz' is such established Hollywood jargon that sometimes it simply must be used with the 'zee'. 'Vis Academy' just didn't have the right ring to it!*
