## Introduction: The Ancient Arts Today

The modern **Theatre Industry** emerges from millennia of storytelling on stage. Attracting great artists and craftspeople, we have always relied on **formalised disciplines and processes** to enable cooperation of a diverse crew- all the while creating ambitious, boundary-pushing storytelling.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

Standardised practices, while not particularly exciting, are essential for live production of any sort. They enable trained professionals to get right to work after first meeting one another, often for the first time.

Without these practices, creative efforts can become chaotic and unproductive. Limitations, clear direction, and certainty, are crucial in delivering a bold, clear vision to an impressive and high standard. [^5]

The theatrical tradition is beyond words on a page. Its success over time, arguably owes its resilience to the respective disciplines that contribute to it- linked by a collective, collaborative culture, likely passed down from long before the time of Shakespeare. [^6]

These disciplines, old and new, work together.

For example, a Theatre Director's skill, arguably in part, is the art of **guiding collective attention** to each beat of a cohesive story, at the right time. Whether using a 'stick in mud', as it were, or an arena performance, these principles remain the same.

Moving on through the creative team, we get closer to the 'nuts and bolts' of technical execution. The tools and methods for these roles tend to evolve more rapidly. Levers of operation that are not communication-based, jump between competing technical platforms, hardware and software.[^7]

Just walk by a lunchtime chat between Lighting Designers, and you will likely hear an encyclopaedia of 'which control desks' and 'which software' might be used- this year, last year, next year. Who pays for what software packages and why? Who will go the extra mile to ensure a last-minute request is taken care of?

Rapid evolution of technology is so central to our time, that this dynamic - updating, upgrading, compatibility and consensus - will undoubtedly remain the same in our industry. Age-old Arts will sit alongside huge changes. [^8]

The consensus of 'Industry Standard' acts as a barrier against the 'hype' that may come with the arrival of new tech.[^9]

But suspicion for the new, can be mistaken for stability- and solvable process issues can be mistaken for the everyday struggle of art. By taking a birds-eye view, we can spot the difference.

**To keep our industry and profession strong, and to avoid needless toil, we must optimize and adapt at every level.** [^10][^11]

Lets zoom in to the role of Lighting Designer in particular. Not long ago, there was no such thing, with Shakespeare or Marlowe exhibited in the open air or under candlelight.

When was Lighting Design formalised? When, and only when, the technological milieu allowed the innovators of the time to explore that new territory and make it so- in this instance, between around 1899 and 1930. [^12]

This lead to the responsibility for Lighting Design taking the form of a dedicated person- or clearly being outlined, one way or the other, with adaptations taking place for smaller productions. 

One moment, Lighting Design was not a thing, and then, it was. 

Similar fundamentals exist today, in that theatre practitioners and innovators harness and adapt the tools of the day, to get them to work well **specifically for the medium of theatre**. [^13]

## It's The Same All Over

We could say that this virtuous cycle of technology and art, of theory and practice, drives the development of technology forward in turn, in all creative industries. 

In the well-funded film industry in particular, Ed Catmull tells the story of how "every major technological breakthrough" in the early days of Pixar, was the result of a creative vision first. [^14]

We discover therefore, that tech is not an 'inevitable thing that we have to deal with'-- but rather, it is shaped by our choices, its inventors **inspired by what we do** as creatives. [^15] What could we putting to use from other fields?.[^16]  

>*“Without great storytelling, technology is a hollow pursuit."* 
>- Edwin Catmull

Today, that kind of plasticity has extended beyond the traditional stage arts to which Williams referred to incorporate all the arts and even the technology contemporary artists are also using to push the boundaries of their fields." - [Rick on Theater](https://rickontheater.blogspot.com/2011/07/relation-of-theater-to-other.html)

	2. Gestaltendes Licht, the "creative light" which creates the highlights and shadows, revealing the three dimensional world, and 
	3. Painted Light, the highlight and shadows painted on the scenery by the scenic artist. This static, painted light, was not a part of Appia's vision.
