## Introduction

We have touched on how the Construction and Architecture industries have embraced previsualization tools. Digital twins, simulations, and virtual prototypes are emerging as common practices and terms. We can see that within industries of scale, simulation and spatial computing is used to streamline workflows and reduce waste. [^1]

In this article we will explore the both Fashion industry, and the Manufacturing industry more broadly. The Fashion sector must optimise for irresistible design at affordable scale. Manufacturing, driving clothing production alongside all other product, is a world often driven by precision, repetition, and efficiency [^2]. Let's investigate.

## Fashioning Virtual Threads

The fashion industry's adoption of previs, and digital workflows in general, has been steadily building as it absorbs tech from the megatrends of each recent technological era[^3].  AI adoption attitudes have been optimistic, yet wary[^4]. The rise and fall of 2020s Metaverse hype saw somewhat of a false summit in fully 'digital fashion', roughly following the COVID-19 pandemic.[^5].

*2020-2023 saw a wave of 'metaverse'-style fashion content. Here, supermodel Eva Herzigova's digital twin poses for a photoshoot.* 


Today, designers can sculpt garments in virtual 3D spaces using software like CLO3D Marvelous Designer [^6] or Browzwear [^7], testing drape, fit, and texture on digital avatars[^8]. Virtual prototypes allow for near-instant iteration, and reduced physical sampling[^9].  

On the customer side, 'Virtual Try On' tools were AR focused early on[^10], with AI image generation leading the charge in recent years[^11]. 

Luxury brands have been seen to create virtual showrooms, offering immersive buying experiences[^12].

From initial concept to e-commerce storefront, previs tools are being touted to minimize physical waste, speeding time-to-market, and enhancing customer experience.[^13]


## The Bigger Picture: Manufacturing

The manufacturing sector more broadly (one of the largest market sectors, accounting for 16% of global GDP[^14]) leverages previs tech from cradle to grave. 

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is standard, but increasingly, sophisticated [digital twins](Glossary.md#Digital%20Twin) allow for complex simulations of products and equipment alike [^15][^16]. Engineers can stress-test virtual prototypes, optimize ergonomics, plan assembly processes, and even train staff in VR environments without physical mock-ups [^17].

For sales and marketing, Augmented Reality (AR) lets customers visualize a new sofa in their living room or understand how a complex piece of machinery operates, simply by pointing their phone [^18]. Efficiency, risk reduction, and enhanced communication are the key drivers.

Recent McKinsey surveys show that 44% percent of manufacturing firms had implemented digital twins, with a furth 15% planning to.[^24]


## Virtual Goods

The online era of Web3 marks an important note in this story[^19]. In the time period between 2021 and 2023, a huge amount of buzz was generate for the ideas of 'web3', NFTs, virtual goods, virtual fashion, and the Metaverse. 

Virtual goods were to be designed, released, and sold, in the same way that real goods would be, allowed for by the merging of physical and digital technology. Many digital design tools, and the impressiveness reached, were seen as hugely important enablers to this, continuing to improve to the present day.

This phenomenon has since died down in the public consciousness, however. Articles referencing 'Virtual Fashion' have not appeared in Business of Fashion magazine for 2 years[^20]. Overall interest seems to be holding level after a steady decline. It seems that the Metaverse was pitched to the world, and the world said 'no, not right now'. 

> *"the biggest criticism is that it looks a bit rubbish - akin to graphics from the 2006 Nintendo Wii rather than the lavish VR experience that Zuckerberg promised."*
>  - BBC, 'Metaverse: What happened to Mark Zuckerberg's next big thing?'[^21]

In the background, away from the headlines, we are seeing the technology that powered this initial wave is being refined and improved. The Metaverse may not have panned out as hoped, but its core pieces will continue to work their way through to us.


## Conclusion

Exploring the previs and design tools used in Fashion and Manufacturing offers valuable perspective for an industry optimized for scale. There's potential for enhanced visualization, better resource management, and perhaps more accessible collaboration, particularly through digital asset libraries. 

This industry's goals are, notably: 
- accurate, cheap mass production
- safety oversight at scale
- marketing - generating user excitement, and quickly identifying product fit

The technology has been optimised for these purposes. Entirely new Virtual Goods market sectors indicate a future uptick in rendering technology for web distribution, which we are beginning to see.

### Key Findings

- Virtual Prototyping: Digital tools allow for detailed virtual creation and testing of physical products (like garments), reducing waste and speeding iteration.
- Digital Twins & Simulation, a common understanding across different industries
- Manufacturing prioritises efficiency and scalability for the production of objects of desire.- with an undeniable level of talent and craft behind the scenes.
- AI: Recent, impressive imagery from diffusion models and GANs, combined with its huge accessibility, has proved a hit with consumers. This has sparked debate in professional sectors and creative industries with ethics & copyright concerns[^1]
