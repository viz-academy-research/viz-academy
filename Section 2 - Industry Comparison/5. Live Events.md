## Introduction

Live events encompass everything from pop concerts and corporate launches, to immersive installations and theatre spectaculars. Overall we see a unique intersection of performance, technology, for the experience of an audience in the space. 

Meticulous planning is required to manage unpredictable variables, and synchronise complex tech elements flawlessly - to communicate key ideas. This field can frequently by high-budget and high-stakes. 

Previsualisation, amongst other digital planning- is becoming beneficial, in particular for client liaison[^1].  The tools that are used, reflect the specific challenges of this sector, particularly the need to integrate diverse technical disciplines in real-time.

While live events can have long lead times, the execution stage (kit prep, transport, 'get-in', the event itself) is short and sharp in comparison. The more complex, the more moving parts, the more preparation is necessary.

## The Live Event Planning Ecosystem

Successfully planning a complex live event requires coordinating numerous layers of design and tech. 

### Spatial & Structural Planning
Foundational planning frequently starts with CAD software (like Vectorworks or AutoCAD). This allows for precise drafting of venue layouts, stage designs, seating plans, and rigging plots, ensuring physical elements fit and are safely supported, to be signed off by all parties.

### Lighting Visualization
Dedicated lighting previs software (such as Vectorworks Spotlight or WYSIWYG) can be employed to develop looks, simulate fixture behaviour, or pre-program complex sequences ahead of time.

### Audio System Design
Skilled engineers calibrate and tune microphones and loudspeakers to the venue- the the hardware itself usually being state-of-the-art, and 'tried-and-true', its capabilities known intimately by sound engineers. 

Specialized tools and systems, like newer Spatial Audio platforms, exist for designing and predicting the performance of complex sound systems within specific venue acoustics, ensuring even coverage and clarity.

### AV Integration & Media Servers 
Events are increasingly reliant on video, projection, and synchronized media playback across multiple surfaces. Specialise AV techs manage complex video routing, mapping, and playback control. Media server hardware can range from dedicated laptops running Qlab and PowerPoint, to real-time AR integration. In the case of more advanced platforms like Disguise or Pixera, full 1:1 AV previsualisation is possible ahead of time.

### Previsualisation in Walkthroughs
Increasingly, real-time game engines like Unreal Engine or Unity are being explored for creating comprehensive 3D simulations of the entire event space ahead of time, allowing stakeholders to experience the environment virtually for signoff[^2] 

## Remarkable Innovations in AV

Platforms like **disguise** (formerly d3) have achieved significant prominence for their capabilities in previsualising all aspects of AV integration. Video playback, projection mapping, real-time effects, and lighting control are created and deployed within a 3D spatial and timeline-based interface.[^3]

This allows designers and technicians to:
* Visualize precisely how media content will appear on complex stages, bespoke screens, or mapped onto architecture.
* Synchronize playback flawlessly across numerous, often unconventional, display outputs.
* Manage and sequence control data for lighting and other elements alongside media.
* Integrate camera tracking and real-time rendering for sophisticated extended reality (XR) productions - this extends to live broadcast applications e.g. sports or news.

This powerful focus on **Audio-Visual (AV) integration** and real-time control has made disguise an industry standard for many high-profile tours and events. Its strength lies in managing final visual output, and ensuring pixel-perfect alignment and playback across complex display canvases, acting as a central hub for the visual elements of the show - an AV **digital twin**. 

Disguise operates best on bespoke hardware and requires a software subscription, and these come at a high cost.

## Interoperability Challenges

While specialized tools excel in their respective domains, the major challenge in live event planning often lies in **integrating** them effectively.  CAD drawings are imported directly into lighting visualisers or projection mappings, often isolated from each other. Audio cues, onstage coordination, and more exist within their own ecosystems operated by respective specialists, working under pressure.[^4]

Achieving a unified digital twin of a live event remains a distant vision, for planning or execution. Specialisations, the cutting edge of excellence in sound, vision or simulation, are confined to major vendors.

**Interoperability** standards are steadily improving today- for instance, major vendors Vectorworks, MA Lighting and ROBE recently collaborated to create the unified file standards of GDTF and MVR, to define 3D, functional lighting fixtures and lighting rigs. The quote below gives a contextual reading.

## Conclusion

Planning for live events demands tools that can handle real-time synchronization, complex integrations, and high-stakes execution. These specialisations are often confined to vendors, with 'vendor lock' and standardisation being seen as challenges. 

AV-centric platforms like Disguise hold a prominent position, showing a certain 'leapfrogging' of systems integration ahead of the status quo. Broader planning and execution relies on teams of specialists and ecosystems to achieve quality. 

### Key Findings

* Planning must ensure flawless synchronization of multiple live elements (audio, video, lighting, effects, performers) in an unpredictable environment.
* Tools specializing in integrated Audio-Visual control, playback, and mapping are a key recent development, and central to many large-scale events. Previsualisation capability leans heavily on simulating AV and lighting within different ecosystems.
* Effective planning involves a combination of tools: CAD for spatial layout, specialized lighting platforms for programming, AV platforms for media, and potentially game engines for simulation in client liaison.
* Seamlessly integrating diverse specialised tools into a cohesive planning and control workflow does not exist as it does in other industries.
