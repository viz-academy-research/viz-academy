## Introduction

Let's establish a shared understanding – a 'ground truth' – of how things typically work today. [^1]  These are the core conventions of modern theatre production.

## Conception and Pre-Production

Before creative work begins, a project's parameters are established by key players.[^2]

- **Rights & Concept**: 
	- Performance rights or secured or new work is commissioned.
- **Budgeting**: 
	- Overall scale of the project is defined
	- Financial plans are put in place
- **Core Team & Vision**: 
	- Producers, Director, Production Manager attached. 
	- Dramaturgs or Casting Directors may join, depending on scale.
- **Initial Recruitment**: 
	- Availability checks carried out for cast and creatives against timelines. 
	- Contractual process begun

## The Standard Production Pathway: From Meetings to Rehearsals

**Early production meetings** start months before rehearsals, remotely or in-person. The Production Manager coordinates schedules, budgets, and logistics, often using their own digital platform. The Producer, Director, Designers, and Stage Management align on story concepts, aesthetics, and deadlines.[^1] 

It’s worth noting that key freelance creatives are often balancing **multiple** projects during this phase. This reality can sometimes constrain communication and availability, adding complexity right from the start.

An overall project momentum begins.

## Siloed Workflows: Rehearsal and Parallel Development

Once rehearsals begin (typically 10am-6pm daily), the Director's focus shifts intensely onto the **performers and the text**. They become relatively insulated, reachable mainly via the Stage Manager (SM) or AD (if present). Communication with the wider team often shrinks to hurried meetings during breaks or, after hours.[^1]

Meanwhile, technical elements develop in parallel. While **placeholder sound or video cues** might feature in the rehearsal room, primary focus remains on honing the actors' performances in relation to the text. Designers may visit in to observe blocking, gathering information for their own off-site work.

The **Stage Management team** (SM, DSM, ASM) becomes the centre of communication and information management, running the rehearsal room, documenting blocking, and logging changes. On smaller productions, the responsibilities of these small teams can be significant in keeping everything together.

## Technical Rehearsal

The **technical rehearsal** ('tech') phase marks the convergence of all production elements, with all relevant cast and creatives being present to build the show on-stage.[^1] 

Actors often spend hours holding positions while lighting cues are built. The process involves slow **'step-throughs'** and **'stagger-throughs'**, sequencing the show **cue by cue** under the guidance of the team. The Deputy Stage Manager's (DSM's) prompt book becomes the operational bible.

Tech week is notorious for **time pressure**, as the true canvas of the show's creation emerges, constructed out of highly detailed cue plans, software, and equipment. 

At the moment that all can be seen together, and the director's vision becomes clearer with proximity, changes become more difficult. Unforeseen conflicts arise and are squashed. Key decisions are made that balance practicality with concept. Snags and tech failures can require pauses and resets. 

Large productions (£1M+) may have months for tech, employing dedicated specialist crews (AV teams, automation operators), and exhibiting to preview audiences to hone the production ready for opening night. Mid-tier (£250k-£1M) and small-scale shows (£50k-£100k) must compromise and compress these timelines. 

Smaller shows, that rely on multi-tasking SMs and creatives, and may tech and open in just 48 hours. 


## Evolving Tools and Practices

Many variations or differing emphasis to the process described above do exist, some of which are listed below.

* **Immersive Theatre** demands new strategies for rehearsal and build.[^3]
* **AV Integration** is an increasing staple, with the bar for visuals raising along with technology.[^3]
* **Staging Automation** in staging is of growing use in large productions.[^5]
* **Solo Operation** of mid-tier shows, with DSMs triggering LX and sound sequences via Qlab, requires extensive preparation and can restrict changes.
* **Less Performers**: Due to constricted budgets, some orchestras blend topline musicians with track, multi-roling and musicianship is more common for actors. 
* **Social Media** is now essential, with teams needing to share and document their process for promotion.[^4]


## Conclusion

We have now fresh in our minds a bird's-eye overview of the production process, combining elements old and new to create theatre in the modern day. Our pursuit to investigate how spatial technology can help us, can only be clear if we first identify issues with how theatre is made today that are purely process-related, which we are calling 'pain points' in this study.

If previsualisation can ease any of these 'pain points', and can prove to be a net positive, than that could be very valuable to out process moving forward.
