## 1. Communication & Coordination

Production relies on bringing together diverse teams of specialists, on and off the stage. Specialisation itself lends itself to a freelance business model for many, consisting 70% of the theatrical workforce in the UK [^2]. Specialisation requires years of education before joining the workforce. With this, comes a unique culture, lexicon, and set of responsibilities for each profession. 

An additional factor here, not helped by larger economic trends, is that key creatives and technicians are often juggling multiple projects **simultaneously**, especially early in the production process. Small windows of time open for meetings and delivery of assets well ahead of rehearsals, requiring a huge contextual switch.[^3]

Despite a culture of excellence and hard work, this asynchronous, brief, often remote communication can lead to misunderstandings or delays in approvals.[^4]

Key roles in production coordination (PM, Producer, SM) in well-meaning efforts to keep things organised, can act as **bottlenecks**: the consequence being that critical creative decisions 'in the back of mind' of the Director can emerge at a late stage. Loose reins on process, on the other hand, can lead to precious effort and time being spent on 'red herrings'.

Both sides of this knife edge represent **information silos** - production-critical information that is behind barriers, often with no documentation, and no point of accountability.

### Impact
- Delays in delivery
- Errors - actions taken based on incomplete or misunderstood information
- Duplicated effort, i.e. teams unknowingly redoing work or chasing down information already available elsewhere





## 2. Resource Scarcity

Recent world event have had negative downstream effects on arts funding, with organisations that have spent a generation receiving subsidy, left to fend for themselves.

Resource scarcity is a difficult topic to discuss. At its core, the premise is simple: the funding allocated towards a production is not sufficient. However, knock on effects such as improper compromise, or lack or adaptation, can be entirely avoidable process issues that can be tackled. The rest of this article will discuss knock-on effects, sudden changes and culture surrounding resource scarcity.
### Hidden issues
While scarcity is a very real thing in our industry today, the _experience_ of a lack of resources or funding within a production can be completely relative, based on prior expectations, or be caused by not tackling hidden process issues. This can be a sign of recent change (culture or training-based), intentional and baked in (project risk-based) or acute symptoms of personal barriers (communication based). Let's try and break these issues down into different categories.

#### Culture or training-based issues
- Issues that can arise from organisations' sudden cutting off from resources could be termed 'resourcefulness scarcity': teams are faced with problems that have not been relevant to prepare for or solve in their entire professional careers. 
- Disunity can emerge and mindsets can clash at these times due to cracks in accountability.
- Ultimately this is downstream from the recent, larger change.
#### Project risk-based issues
- Artistic ambition can stretch beyond stated means - calculated risk necessary for a 'breakthrough' project.[^6] 
- Resources may get channelled unevenly due to historical habits.[^7]
- Venturing into new territory carries an 'opportunity cost' which can be hard to measure.[^8]
- Ever-increasing audience and stakeholder expectations can create a _perceived_ scarcity from the team's perception of 'not having hit the mark'.[^9]
- Hiring of inexperienced or unsuitable people can present their and other departments with unforeseen barriers.
#### Communication-based issues
- Inefficiencies fuelled by communication breakdowns, a lack of transparency or trust that hinders true collaboration, or simply outdated workflows – these can burn through available resources at an alarming rate, leading to scarcity.[^10] 
- Scarcity also manifests when talented practitioners withdraw their full engagement, or leave the project or industry altogether, due to unsustainable working conditions or unresolved conflicts.[^11] 

### Impact
- Lack of resources but pressure on labour being the driving force. This is a 'downward' pressure to the workforce that can decrease morale in 'below deck' and in small teams overall.[^12]
- The Peter Principle is also at play here - those who are efficient in a resource-scarce environment, end up with more to do.
- As has been explored: resource scarcity can occur at any level, and cause impacts downstream to any lower level, that can be hard to quantify or measure. 
- Burn-though of cost can be hard to rectify: once it's gone, it's gone.


## 3. Late-stage Integration

Tech Week is when design, performance, and technology converge physically for the first time under immense pressure. Here we reap what was sown in rehearsal and pre-production, the effects being: 

- Discovery of unforeseen spatial/technical conflicts only when elements meet on stage.[^13] 
- Inflexibility - Difficulty adapting to changes or solving complex problems within the compressed timeframe. Can leads to unforeseen cuts or other compromises.[^14]

#### Impact
- Intense stress
- Costly last-minute fixes
- Potential artistic compromises
- Inefficient use of valuable venue/crew time[^15]


## 4. Managing Complexity and Expectation

Modern forms like musical theatre inherently combine multiple complex elements – songs, dialogue, acting, dance, _and technical aspects_ (set, costumes, props, lighting, sound) – into an "integrated whole". Coordinating these requires sophisticated management and technical oversight.[^16]

The documented skills shortages across _multiple_ technical disciplines (sound, lighting, automation, carpentry) in the UK theatre industry highlight the high level of specialized technical skill currently required to stage professional productions[^17], as well as:

- Increasing technical demands of modern productions (multimedia, automation etc.). 
- Pressure to deliver high production values across different scales.[^18] 

#### Impact: 
- Increased cognitive load and stress on specialists, higher potential for critical failures if systems aren't robustly planned.[^19] 
- It stands to reason that current conditions may act as a deterrent for specialists to enter or stay within the theatre industry. 'You have to love it'.


## 5. Burnout

The cumulative effect of these interconnected pressures – communication struggles, resource strain, late-stage crunches, and escalating complexity – takes a significant toll. **Widespread burnout** and mental health challenges are increasingly recognized across the industry.[^20]

This is compounded by:
- Precarious work insecurities of freelance life can add financial and emotional stress.[^21]
- Challenging communication dynamics or pressured environments can impact workplace culture, and individual wellbeing.[^22]

#### Impact:
- **Unexpected project errors**: A burnt out workforce is less reliable in terms of judgment, timekeeping and many aspects of professional discipline
- **Trust and risk taking imbalance**: Burnt out team members may err on the wrong side of the knife edge of risk management: playing it too safe by not speaking up, or seeking a shortcut by cutting corners.
- **Talent Drain:** Experienced professionals leave the industry, seeking more sustainable careers.[^23]
- **Ethical Concerns:** Questions arise about the industry's duty of care to its workforce.
- **Sustainability Crisis:** The long-term health of the art form depends on the wellbeing of its people.



## Conclusion: Necessary vs Unnecessary

So, back to our central question. Creating theatre will always involve challenges, as is the case with any artistic process. Discipline, immense creativity, and deep collaboration is required in the pursuit of excellence.[^24]

However, many of these specific pain points - particularly those rooted in **communication breakdowns, workflow inefficiencies, fragmented information management, and late-stage integration conflicts** - feel less like artistic striving and more like process-related problems.[^25] 

This is where the opportunity lies. Exploring new workflows and technologies, or adapting those from elsewhere, shows promise for genuine improvement.[^26]

These pain points are a key reference for us, as we deem whether, and how, previsualisation and spatial technology can help theatre moving forward. Let's get ready to do that in the next article.
