## Introduction

We’ve established the conventional workflows of modern theatre production, and pinpointed recurring pain points that can cause friction or strain our resources. We can now see ourselves in wider context of creative industry: one of emerging innovations that could help us save time and solve issues.

But unless we are directly addressing process issues, we cannot guarantee a net benefit to adopting new technology or changing practices, as has been observed elsewhere.

Luckily, we are seeing instances of previsualisation already taking hold in our own industry, along with academic research, that we can study to see how they can help.

## Framing the Core Challenge

Theatre’s production timeline, typically 6-12 months for large shows, demands rapid iteration and coordination across deeply specialized departments.

Unlike film, where previs can be a linear, pre-shoot process, theatre’s essential creative period happens during rehearsal, with all elements converging in tech. Research suggests theatre’s 'slower' tech adoption stems from this complexity, and relatively small scale so as not to be targeted by tech innovators[^7].  There’s also the fact that all software and technology must work live, every night, a high bar for a small world[^8]. 

## Examining Case Studies

Before proposing definitive pathways forward for adoption, let's examine a series of case studies, spanning academic works, new companies, and observations of standards adoption.

Each case study will be compared against process pain points we have established, making further comparison if necessary.
