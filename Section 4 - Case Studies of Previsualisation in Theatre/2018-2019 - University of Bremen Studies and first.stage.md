These theoretical studies by the University of Bremen, explore using VR as a means of previsualising work for professionals working across different creative industries.

The two papers have been published as 'Extended Abstracts' of the 2018[^1] and 2019[^2] CHI conferences. The project received funding as part of 'first.stage', a grant agreement of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

first.stage aimed to create software for use in film, animation, and theatre[^3]. The project shows its last progress being in 2019[^4], and seems to have influenced motion capture products from Rokoko. 

Working VR software was created by this project, but is not available in the public domain at present. Demonstrations of the software are shown in full functionality[^5], and in use of theatre specific tools[^6], showing a single-person VR user interfaces operated by handheld controllers.

The theoretical and survey work around this project is interesting and validating to our present thesis and context. We proceed with a surface level summary of the study papers, moving into contextual depth with industry analysis, and finally addressing Pain Points from the previous section.

## VR for Spatial Understanding (Muender et al., 2018)

An early study testing VR previs prototypes yielded encouraging results. Theatre professionals engaged with tools designed for tasks like exploring virtual stage designs and assessing sightlines. Notably, the technology proved accessible even for those without extensive technical backgrounds. Participants found VR intuitive for navigating virtual spaces and manipulating elements, quickly grasping its utility for spatial planning tasks inherent to theatre. 

> As the researchers noted, _"Even participants with little experience in 3D tools were able to use the prototypes after a short introduction and stated that they found VR useful for professional work"_ [^7].  

However, the way theatre professionals used these tools differed significantly from their film counterparts. While film users focused on camera work, reflecting mature previs pipelines, theatre users concentrated on stage layout and physical constraints – highlighting the unique spatial demands of live performance. Practical issues like headset comfort and limited multi-user functions were also identified as hurdles.

## Tailoring Tools for the Stage (Muender et al., 2019)

Further analysis comparing previs tasks across animation, film, and theatre reinforced these distinctions. Film and animation rely on standardized workflows and generalized 3D software (like Maya or Blender) for detailed scene and camera planning. Theatre shares some goals, like lighting or scenic layout, as well as roles in the creative team, but requires functionalities specifically addressing its unique context on-stage.  

Crucially, theatre previs must account for the live audience experience and the physical reality of the stage space. This involves unique considerations not central to screen-based media; 

> _"theatre experts emphasized the necessity to consider the visibility from the audience’s perspective and the limitations of the stage when setting up a scene"_ [^8]. 

This study underlined that theatre is still adapting previs tools, needing solutions tailored to its specific spatial challenges, indicating a less standardized approach compared to film.

## Analysis

### Contextual Analysis
#### Historical context and notes on use and adoption

It is important to consider the historical context of these studies: Film previsualisation with conventional technology had already seen a golden age by the 2010s, and spatial technology in film was debuted in 2009 with James Cameron's Avatar. Since then, VR has not itself become a standard in creative industries, but the virtues of XR and Spatial Computing have propagated through those areas which teams can interface with easily during normal collaborative settings. 

It seems that the progress vector pursued with these studies, was in developing intuitive user interface processes for non-technical creatives in XR space, an essential step for mass adoption in any case, with VR's assumed virtues, during the time period (2018-2022, post Oculus Meta acquisition), that VR could be said to have been in its 'honeymoon phase'. 

What time may have proven is that the limitations and isolation of VR disqualify it from most creative teams at most times. 

>  while VR offers many advantages, it also conveys challenges in user acceptance, exhaustion in long term use, and potential motion sickness.
   > *- Introduction, 2018 Study*


#### Hope for VR, in theatre production
There have been documented instances in 2025, with full case studies on the way, in which that a single Quest Pro headset has been employed during an early 'meet and greet' that creatives can take turns to 'peep through' and take a look at a set visualisation of a stage play, in a non-interactive way, that has added value to the production process. But this is not unseating laptops and iPads just yet in being absolutely essential. 

Another instance is Preevue's key advantage, seen in a later case study, of sightline and QA signoff for remounted shows, performed by key stakeholders, at times where they cannot visit venues in person (e.g. global tours).

#### Barriers

> "Against our expectation, we found that our participants were predominantly positive towards VR for previs and rated it as a useful technology. Our prototypes showed that all users could perform typical 3D previs tasks even after very short learning times. Using the prototypes also convinced participants of the practical use of VR for previs and removed certain doubts."
> **- Conclusion, 2018 Study**

This excerpt shows a clear positive signal. Contrasting with a lack of mass adoption of VR in theatre production arenas suggest a few scenarios:

VR seems to be successful in bespoke, purposeful projects that optimise for its use, but as yet not in the hybrid, in-person environments that make up theatre and other creative production environments. Ultimately VR, in its isolating nature, puts a physical barrier between the user's perceived reality and others around them. 

It brings to mind the popular party VR game 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes', where a single user in VR tasked with diffusing a bomb, and the party around them have the instructions on how to do it. The panic and frustration that emerges is all part of the fun in this instance, but one couldn't help but imagine why VR use is avoided outside of highly controlled settings.

This is not to mention that in the popular consciousness, viral videos  feature VR users as woefully out of touch with their physical surroundings, the results ranging from hilarious to injurious. 

> "VR is mostly limited to one user at a time, making it not suited for every situation - previs is a collaborative process often including multiple persons." 
> *- Discussion, 2019 Study*

Theoretically, AR or mixed reality would also present social difficulties to collaboration in-person. Communicating creative visions is hard enough with words alone within a team; let alone one or a few members of a group having access to certain corporeal phenomena that the others are not. 

Successful applications of VR seem to be when everyone shares the same 'space', whether physically or virtually. 

And even as the human limbic system is fooled by the transportation VR provides, practitioners who are creating for the live stage in mind, will face limitations in 'visualisation', when the full spectrum of colour and luminance to the human eye is not represented in the tech - especially with critical lighting applications.[^9]

To re-iterate. it is evident that the 'solution horizon' was closer to VR use for filmmaking at this time:

- most academic references in the studies were Film-related
- At the time of publishing of the studies, many high profile films were in production using early VR tech (HTC Vive in the case of The Lion King)

#### Other remarks

It is worth highlighting the excerpt below, as it echoes the aims of our Industry Studies Overview.

> "Previs has been used for decades in all visual design disciplines such as film, product design, and architecture and gains increasing popularity through the steady advancement of technology. Although previs has many advantages for production, it is time consuming and requires trained personnel."
> *- Introduction, 2018 Study*

> "Typically, complex 3D tools such as Maya, Blender, and recently game engines such as Unity and Unreal are used for previs. However, the operation of these 3D applications and game engines is very complex, time consuming and requires skilled technical users or programmers. Thus, excluding creative, non-technical users such as directors and producers from the previs production process, requiring many iterations of design and communication between creative personnel and technical staff."
> *- Introduction, 2018 Study*

This information is critical for a realist, practical view on previsualisation. In our Film Industry analysis, we noted an improper consolidation of power that can occur towards senior management and visualisation technicians, and away from creatives, that can occur in large productions due to the high skill ceiling currently demanded from 3D tools. 

VR could be seen, in these studies as one example, as an attempt to remedy this, and will be key to remember as we look to later studies and success stories, especially the recent development of 'Virtual Stage'.

> "Eight domain experts were interviewed in the process of identifying tasks typical in theater previs. The main difference in theatre productions compared to film is the fact that staff members are working on a single immobile asset - the stage."
> *- Identification of Previs Tasks, 2019 Study*

This echoes the thesis put forward in [the first article in section 1](1.%20The%20Theatre%20Industry%20and%20Technology.md), and later developments as we will see. These are deceptively simple facts. The stage is a real experience, not a screen. It cannot be easily prototyped, [like a product created with CAD](3.%20Fashion%20and%20Manufacturing.md). And it must facilitate immersion by a living company of actors, unlike large scale [Architecture](2.%20Architecture.md) projects.



### Pain Points Addressed In Detail

#### Late-Stage Integration & Spatial Conflicts:
The studies strongly suggest VR's potential in this area. Participants intuitively used the prototypes for "exploring virtual stage designs," "assessing sightlines," and understanding "stage layout and physical constraints."[^7] 
#### Communication & Coordination
By providing a shared virtual space that even non-technical users found accessible[^7], VR shows promise for enhancing collaboration and shared understanding of designs between directors, designers, and potentially other stakeholders, potentially reducing misunderstandings that arise from interpreting 2D drawings or static models.
#### Resource Scarcity
While not a direct focus, identifying spatial issues or facilitating clearer communication _earlier_ could reduce costly late-stage fixes and wasted effort, thus making more efficient use of limited time and budget.


### Tools & Workflows:

#### Tools 
The core technology was purpose-built **VR prototypes** running on standard VR hardware (implying headsets). The limitations noted ("headset comfort," "limited multi-user functions")[^7] highlight the dependence on the capabilities of the hardware available at the time.
#### Workflows
The observed workflow differed significantly from film. Theatre professionals focused on **navigating the virtual stage, manipulating elements to understand spatial relationships, and assessing audience sightlines**.[^7] 

This contrasts sharply with film's camera-centric previs workflow. The 2019 study reinforced that theatre requires workflows considering the "visibility from the audience’s perspective and the limitations of the stage."[^8]

### Cross-Industry Comparison:
The comparison is explicit and central to the findings. While sharing goals like lighting/scenic layout, theatre's use of previs fundamentally diverged from **film and animation**. Film/animation rely on mature, standardized pipelines often using generalist 3D software (Maya, Blender) for detailed shot planning.[^8] 

Theatre's focus, as observed, was uniquely **spatial and experiential**, centred on the physical stage and live audience perspective, indicating a need for tailored approaches rather than direct adoption.[^7][^8]

### New Challenges & Opportunities:

#### Opportunities
The key opportunity identified was VR's **intuitive nature and accessibility**, even for users without prior 3D software experience.[^7] This lowers the barrier to entry for leveraging visualization for spatial understanding and collaboration.
#### Challenges
Several hurdles emerged: **practical hardware limitations** (comfort, multi-user capability)[^7]; the fundamental realization that **generic tools are insufficient** and theatre requires functionalities specifically addressing its unique context[^8]; and the implication that theatre **lacks the standardized previs pipelines** seen in other fields.


### Transferability & Scalability:

#### Transferability
The finding that the tools were intuitive for non-experts is positive for transferability across different roles within a production team. The _concept_ of using VR for spatial checks seems broadly applicable.
#### Scalability 
Significant challenges exist here. The identified hardware limitations (though potentially lessening with newer tech) and the crucial need for **theatre-specific software features and workflows**[^8] hinder immediate, widespread, scalable adoption. Off-the-shelf film/animation tools aren't a perfect fit, meaning true scalability might require further development of bespoke theatre solutions or significant adaptation of existing platforms, which could pose cost and expertise barriers, especially for smaller (£50k-£100k) productions. The lack of standardized workflows also complicates scaling across the industry.


## Conclusion

The Bremen studies serve as a foundational benchmark. They clearly demonstrated VR's potential for tackling core theatre pain points related to spatial planning and communication in an intuitive way. However, they crucially highlighted that theatre cannot simply copy-paste tools or workflows from film. Success hinges on overcoming practical limitations and, more importantly, developing solutions _specifically tailored_ to the unique spatial and experiential demands of live performance. This case study underscores the need for theatre-centric innovation in the visualization space.
