## Building a Virtual Stage

The UOL researchers meticulously created a **digital twin** of the physical theatre stage, capturing dimensions down to the centimetre, including backstage areas and architectural details. Using standard modelling software and Unreal Engine, they built an environment that mirrored the real space, viewable through VR headsets. 

This model served as a dynamic planning tool for the production team, comprising designers, actors, choreographers, and technicians. 

During design workshops, this VR experience was presented alongside traditional tools like sketches, physical models, and blueprints, offering a new way to engage with the design.

### Enhanced Collaboration

For the theatre creative team, stepping into the virtual theatre was reported to yield immediate benefits, particularly in **spatial comprehension**. 

The study reported that viewing the digital twin via VR headsets allowed team members to perceive the stage space more effectively than with other methods. 

This was especially true for those unfamiliar with the physical venue, who could gain a clearer, more intuitive grasp of scale, layout, and sightlines. Participants felt this early, shared visualization helped unify the team, enhance the transparency of the design process, and allowed potential staging problems to be identified and adjusted much earlier than usual.

The **digital twin** also proved a valuable communication tool. It created a common ground where the team could discuss movement, set placement, and design choices with a shared visual reference, in a unique way not possible otherwise. This was said to streamline discussions and iterative changes, offering potential savings in time and resources.

The usability of the VR system itself was rated favourably, suggesting the technology, while new to the participants, was not overly cumbersome once introduced.

#### Options and Acclimatisation to Spatial Tools

It is also notable, that along with being provided access to Quest 2 headsets, the team was provided access to the 3D models and assets on their laptops and mobile devices. It was documented that the creative team more frequently 'checked' these more familiar devices for design or blocking reference, than they did don the VR headset. 

This is both a positive signal; and reasoning can be clearly seen from the creatives here: they are getting used to using **spatial** assets to aid decision making in theatre production; infrequently visiting immersive tools for virtual walkarounds, enhancing their spatial understanding well ahead of time, and reinforcing this awareness with commonplace digital items we all carry. This is critical information, and a testament to how familiarisation and presentation of options, can empower creatives to find their best way through challenges and the creative process.

>"Despite none of the participants having prior experience with VR tools in theater production design or specific expertise in using them, they generally viewed the VR model very positively. The participants reported that the use of VR and 3D models reduced the time and cost compared to the traditional design process. The traditional process involved the creation of physical mockups, which were time-consuming and expensive to produce. However, with the use of VR and 3D models, the team was able to create a virtual mockup before any material was used, which was more cost-effective."
>*- Findings, UOL Study, 2023*

### Reality Check

Despite the clear advantages, the study underscored that VR **wasn't a complete replacement** for established methods. 

While participants appreciated the virtual exploration, getting accustomed to the VR headsets and navigation required guidance and time. None of the participants owned VR headsets personally, relying on equipment provided for the workshop. 

Furthermore, the technical expertise needed to build and manage the digital twin requires specialist skills, indicating a potential barrier to use dedicated support, with the current technology, public familiarity and platforms in existence.

The tactile sense of materials, the atmosphere of the physical space, and the ease of simultaneous group discussion around a physical model were missing elements. [^2]

Participants noted that while VR offered an excellent preview, it didn't eliminate the need for physical site visits to check details like safety routes, or experience the space first-hand. 

Interestingly, while VR was highly valued for initial immersion and understanding, the team also frequently referred to simpler 3D models on laptops or phones for quick checks, especially when practicality demanded portability (like verifying materials at a hardware store).

>The theater group had previously used physical miniature models as an aid in stage design, but in the future, felt that this could be replaced, at least partially, by VR.
>*- Findings, UOL Study, 2023*



## Analysis

### Pain Points
#### Late-Stage Integration & Spatial Conflicts
This was a primary focus. By providing early virtual access to an accurate replica of the stage space, the digital twin/VR combination allowed team members (especially those unfamiliar with the venue) to gain a much clearer, intuitive grasp of scale, layout, and sightlines. This enabled potential staging problems to be identified and adjusted significantly earlier than traditional methods might allow, directly mitigating the risk of late-stage discoveries during tech.
#### Communication & Coordination
The study highlights substantial benefits here. The shared virtual environment served as a "common ground," fostering unified understanding, enhancing transparency, and streamlining discussions about movement, placement, and design choices. This shared visual reference reportedly improved collaboration effectiveness.
#### Resource Scarcity
While not measured quantitatively, the study suggests potential efficiencies. By facilitating earlier problem-solving and potentially clearer communication, the approach offered savings in time and resources compared to the iterative process of building and modifying physical mock-ups.
#### Managing Complexity
The immersive nature of VR helped the team grapple with the complexities of the stage space, particularly relevant for the interactive production being designed.


### Transferability & Scalability
#### Transferability
The demonstrated benefits for spatial understanding and communication seem highly transferable, particularly for complex productions, remote teams, or when working in unfamiliar venues. 
#### Scalability
This remains a major challenge. The requirement for **specialist skills** to create high-fidelity digital twins presents a significant barrier for smaller organizations (£50k-£100k) lacking technical staff or budget. **Hardware costs and accessibility** are also factors.


### Contextual analysis

It could be said that this study is a theoretical exploration of Preevue Ltd's professional experience in providing this service on a larger scale. The theatre project targeted here seems to be smaller-scale than a West End show. The managed 'digital twin' service is offered to the theatre creatives in parallel to traditional methods, i.e. as an option, and the results and insights are measured under normal circumstances of building a show.

It is compelling how the data points, and points of analysis and observation, dovetail well with those explored in the rest of this series of articles, theoretical and case studies alike. Take this excerpt nothing the spatial nature of theatre as relates to use of technology, as well as referencing other studies in similar ways. This excerpt could have been taken from the first article in this study, "The Theatre Industry and Technology".

> "Theatre production involves various teams working independently towards a shared goal. Set design and script-based production, for instance, are conducted separately, with actors rehearsing off-stage before the final assembly. Disciplines like film, animation, and theatre rely on a detailed planning phase, known as previsualization (previs), to explore ideas, plan technical solutions, and communicate a shared vision (Okun & Zwerman, 2010). Previs is a key part of pre-production, aiding in cost-efficient scene and shot planning (Ardal et al., 2019). However, in theatre, most of the team doesn’t see the staging until final rehearsals, despite some previsuals like sketches being shared earlier."
> *Introduction, UOL Study, 2023*


University of Bremen studies are referenced frequently, along with further studies concerning human interface design.

>Although prior work on digital twins has predominantly focused on manufacturing systems, the value of the approach in socio-technical design has been noted (Barricelli, Casiraghi, & Fogli, 2019). The use of VR-based tools for film and theatre previsualization tasks has been reported as beneficial, especially for non-technical personnel who can naturally explore the build space (Muender, Fröhlich, & Malaka, 2018; Muender et al., 2019).
>*- Background, UOL Study, 2023*


Sentiments are echoed here about VR's honeymoon phase and how previsualisation technology should enable decision making, rather than dazzling users in professional settings.

>Although emerging technologies such as VR offer new opportunities for creative work, it is crucial to have a good understanding of the tool's features and controls to fully benefit from its positive effects. In their study exploring VR tools in design education, Häkkilä et al. (2018) report that it is essential to look beyond the effects of novelty and unfamiliarity with the technology to recognize its long-term value.
>*- Background, UOL Study, 2023*


The following quote outlines disparity in the levels of 'immersion' or 'realism' provided by VR. 

>Participants reported conflicting levels of realism for the VR experience. Whilst some felt it was very realistic and admired its similarity to reality, others believed that VR could not provide the same feeling as reality. VR and reality were perceived to complement each other in terms of space modeling and experiencing the space.


### Hardware analysis

Appearances show that the study utilized Meta Quest 2 headsets, decent, practical VR models for the consumer market, retailing at about £300 at the time, far and away from £1500 cost of the Varjo Aero headset seen in other studies. It should be noted that the Quest 2 is a completely 'standalone' VR headset, not needing a high performance PC to operate. The VR 'app', build in UE5, was likely sideloaded into the headset ahead of sessions with the theatre creatives. This lack of a wired, PC-tethered experience, may have put forward a more practical and accessible impression, as opposed to experiences with XR Stage or early in Preevue's life[^1]. 

Public perception may have affected experience; creatives or members of the public may have been more familiarised with VR as an activity by 2023, than they were in the years before.



## Conclusion

The Lapland study paints a realistic picture of digital twins and VR in contemporary theatre design.

> "Our results indicate that VR and the developed 3D models played a crucial role in the staging team's workflow. The digital twin also facilitated communication and collaboration among team members, as it enabled them to share a common understanding of the design."
> *- Conclusion, UOL Study, 2023*


The technologies offered compelling benefits for visualizing complex spaces, fostering shared understanding, and potentially improving efficiency, empowering a small creative team.

The research firmly concludes that these tools, as they exist at the time of the study, are most effective as complementary aids. enhance, the invaluable insights gained from physical models, material samples, and physical venue visits. 

One could imagine how, as photo and video have become commonplace tools used in remote communication and the expression of ideas, spatial tools may join these ranks as tools become more accessible.
