The Finnish National Opera (FNO) entered into a strategic partnership with Younite, a Finnish AI startup, in late 2024, securing a rights deal to develop and commercialize the **XR Stage**[^26] platform, rebranding as **Younite Virtual Stage**.[^1] 

The stated goal is to establish Virtual Stage as a global standard for stage design and production planning within the performing arts, moving from Unreal Engine to a more advanced toolset, based on the open source OpenUSD platform. No software release strategy is stated, with a Younite offering a service-based collaboration as the Virtual Stage offering at present. 

Currently, the project seems to be in an early stage of exposure, with initial videos released on the product's capabilities, similar to FNO's campaign surrounding XR Stage in 2023.

Younite is a well-funded, international organisation that operates across several industries, accomplished in tech and creative projects.

## Introduction

During the time period of our studies, we have witnessed a Theatre Industry that has shown measured interest, and development, into previs technology. We have seen positive feedback from creative teams, and success stories emerging from leading organisations and vendors, who have begun to look towards future potential. 

Two delivery models of this technology exist in the industry. Service-based previs, like what is offered by Preevue or freelance teams, and software-based previs, which is offered by CAD and lighting platforms at present, for the creative use of lighting designers and 3D artists. 

The business models, and nascent stage of the tech, mean that both delivery models exist as walled gardens, confined either to 
- a single discipline (e.g. lighting or set design)
- as a service, with in-house skills and custom workflows

The scale simply has not been there for companies to go beyond one model or the other. Let's briefly point out where the restrictions lie in this scenario, showing a gap to wider adoption of previsualisation in industry.

### Service model

A luxury service for the highest-end productions in the Theatre Industry, whether through 
- a 3rd party vendor (ex. Preevue)
- employing specific freelancers (ex. National Theatre)
- or developing in-house technology (ex. FNO, XR Stage). 

Adoption of these more advanced service practices remains low, and full previsualisation software workflows from freelancers are constricted by timelines. We could point to a few barriers: 

- High cost of entry
- High knowledge & skill barrier
- Lack of awareness 
- Lack of standard protocol in the use of emerging technology
- Skepticism of new vs. traditional practices
- Lack of easy to use tools and training
- Real inefficiencies ('opportunity cost') associated with early adoption

### Software model

Previsualisation capabilities are found in specific platforms:

- Lighting software
- CAD software
- Cinematic 3D software
- Specific custom software developed for research / R&D

Some of these platforms can ingest lighting plots, some can render well, some support cue creation. But none all at the same time.


## A potential next stage in development

The limited scope at present, leads to:

- limitations of current delivery models
- limited demand for capable tools
- limited appeal and utility
- limited adoption. 

Where the tools and skills exist, there are good results. But each tool that is created, each skill barrier removed, requires enormous investment and research. 

Taking these steps is required to move closer to mass adoption in industry.

What we have seen in recent months, in the case of **Younite Virtual Stage**, may spell the next stage in the process, laying the groundwork for a commercial offering that may eliminate barriers to both Service and Software.


### The technology landscape around Virtual Stage

In 2023, XR Stage was developed as a "groundbreaking virtual design tool" for opera. At the time, it was the most ambitious 'productisation' of spatial previs technology into software for the Theatre Industry, generating some buzz- though its scale impact and adoption rate was low[^2]. In the present day (Spring 2025), service-based delivery for previs using existing tools (e.g. National Theatre using 3ds Max, or Preevue using Unreal Engine), remains the standard. 

In the wider world today, ambitions for the use of 'compute' power have since expanded from the prospect of VR, XR and the Metaverse, which dominated the popular discourse at the turn of the 2020s. Global trends indicate a 'honeymoon phase' of VR/XR optimism, and we can even look at organisations and figures once enamoured entirely with the prospect of VR and the Metaverse[^3], expand and spearhead into the megatrend of recent years: AI.[^4]

Industry does have a more pragmatic, mature view of VR/XR today than it did yesteryear. The underlying hardware infrastructure that made it possible, however, has been expanding steadily since. VR, XR, spatial computing, social media, and now 'web3' and AI all rely on this effective use of the latest **compute power**, at a huge scale. Building on top of existing cloud infrastructure,[^5] large data centres containing Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), have been very powerful for building the latest AI tools - but, these can also be used for:

- Graphical processing, and pre-rendering
- Running large online platforms
- Developing new software

This modern infrastructure, taken as a whole, spells out a new set of capabilities that are wielded by the latest generation of technology startups- which have the ability to achieve scale and impact for many industries.

### Who is Younite?

Younite seems to be emerging as one such tech startup in this new generation, their USP seemingly being to deliver highly specific, original solutions for high profile clients in many different fields - including, the in-house creation of highly complex **digital twins** of large systems, like megayachts, vehicles, even entire cities. 

**Virtual Stage** is now being developed as part of Younite's service offering. Younite's theatre services look very similar to Preevue's and others at present, offering previs delivery by their team, without selling their software- but the scope to expand beyond this is built into their organisation in a different way.


### The Virtual Stage Platform Shift

XR Stage, Virtual Stage's predecessor, was built on the Unreal Engine platform, likely using custom plugins, asset libraries and compiled projects in a way commonly used for small VR service apps.

A pivotal aspect of Younite's strategy appears to be the shift from this practice towards a custom toolset, built around the OpenUSD[^6] standard. This small detail indicates a much larger investment in a platform like this than ever before, and aligns with industry calls for greater interoperability and efficiency.

OpenUSD, developed by Pixar and now backed by an alliance including major players like NVIDIA, Autodesk, and Adobe, aims to be the "HTML for 3D," providing a common framework for describing, composing, and collaborating on complex 3D scenes. 

Younite is an NVIDIA Partner, indicating a strong incentive to build Virtual Stage alongside NVIDIA Omniverse: a platform built upon OpenUSD, that leverages NVIDIA's RTX ray-tracing technology[^7]. 

Unreal Engine, though a giant boon for 3D creation owing to its fidelity, community and asset library, is ultimately a closed platform with game development at its core - itself facing competition from Unity and others.[^8] Unreal's Lumen lighting engine, and MegaLights features, are impressive and can yield photorealistic results - yet all will be optimised for realtime performance only, this incurring a certain 'fidelity cap' which necessitates workarounds to true realism.[^9] 

Using OpenUSD, and likely NVIDIA Omniverse, Younite is primed to use its substantial resources to develop a highly **optimized application specifically tailored for theatre use cases**, which could help to establish OpenUSD as an open-source file interchange standard for other platforms, practitioners and vendors to build upon.[^10]

### Potential Impact

#### Industry in general

These foundational pieces are certainly intriguing at the early stage of this platform, and it is certainly worth understanding what they mean, so we can calculate future impact. 

If developed and scaled successfully beyond its current service model, Younite has the potential to follow AutoCAD or Disguise to establish **Virtual Stage as a de facto standard for previsualisation**. Key factors like early market presence, strategic partnerships, and broad compatibility are all in place. 

Other factors will strengthen long term value of this previsualisation platform from the industry at large:

- 1st/3rd party generation of large asset OpenUSD asset libraries (e.g. staging or set pieces from rental houses, props)
- Cooperation of other vendors and tools in partnership or independently
- Positive case studies from diverse organisations and productions
- Interoperability with existing standards, e.g. GDTF and MVR standards for lighting

For this capability to 'break through' and extend past high-end clients, Younite would need to commit significant cost to create a software platform for users beyond their in-house team. 

However, Virtual Stage does have potential to expand past theatre into the Live Events industry more generally (even Immersive or Virtual Events), which would yield significant ROI in the event of adoption in this industry. Success stories like Disguise or Qlab are the result of breaking new ground.


#### Adoption and standards

This overall potential however, is looking like a good thing for previsualisation adoption in our industry. 

Risks for Younite can be seen as benefits for the practitioners who will be the consumers of this software. This may encourage other players to get in on the action: competition from other vendors will incentivise quality, value and functionality. 

MVR and GDTF are de-facto industry standards for lighting fixtures, and are open source. Future prominence of Virtual Stage could mean that OpenUSD becomes the de-facto industry standard for previsualisation. If compatibility was established between OpenUSD and MVR and GDTF, greater re-purposing and sharing could occur between all modern 3D creation software and vendor specific tools like VendorWorks Spotlight or WYSIWYG.


![](younite3.jpg)

The above photo from the Younite website, shows a technician operating a grandMA2 console, which is adjusting lights within a 3D environment. This direct control from lighting desks was not observed in prior versions of the software. This hints at possible HID control or integration already built unto Virtual Stage via ArtNet or DMX- and evidences interoperability goals we have theorised.


## Pain Points

While Younite Virtual Stage is still in its early stages, its stated goals and technological foundation suggest it aims to address several core theatre production pain points:

### Communication & Coordination
By adopting OpenUSD and potentially NVIDIA Omniverse, Virtual Stage would establish an open standard for previsualisation - moving beyond the limitations of Unreal Engine. Direct HID control from lighting desks signals a move towards complete cross-platform integration for the creative team.

### Late-Stage Integration
The platform's core function as an advanced previsualization tool, allowing teams to build and interact with complex digital twins early in the process, is fundamentally designed to catch spatial conflicts, design issues, and technical challenges long before costly physical tech rehearsals. 

### Managing Complexity
Younite's expertise in creating complex digital twins for other industries, combined with Omniverse's capacity for handling large datasets and complex scenes, positions Virtual Stage to potentially simplify the management of intricate opera and theatre productions within a unified virtual environment. 

### Resource Scarcity
Although initially a high-end service likely targeting well-resourced productions, the *potential* for Virtual Stage to eventually become accessible software holds promise for reducing resource strain more broadly. 

If adopted widely, standardized workflows and reduced duplication could save time; however, the significant **cost and skill barriers** associated with such advanced platforms remain a major hurdle that needs to be overcome for this benefit to be widely realised. 


## Conclusion: A Potential Catalyst

Younite Virtual Stage, born from FNO's XR Stage and rebuilt on the promising foundations of OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse, represents a significant investment signal in this field, and could move theatre previsualisation towards broader use through its services and software. 

Younite's reliance on OpenUSD holds the key to potentially overcoming **interoperability challenges** faced by increasing 3D asset use in theatre, by its endorsement of the technology alone.

Currently offered as a high-end service, a future transition to licensable software will be dependent on platform maturity, market demand, and competitive strategy. This could **partially democratise** access if cost and training barriers are mitigated.

Virtual Stage signals a new level of technological ambition, potentially acting as a catalyst for transforming digital workflows in theatre.
