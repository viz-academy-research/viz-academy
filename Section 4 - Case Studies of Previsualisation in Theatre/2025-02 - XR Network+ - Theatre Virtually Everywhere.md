## Summary

>"The projects are bringing together experts from academia and the creative industries to explore new techniques that combine traditional stagecraft with virtual production technologies such as performance capture, game engine software and virtual reality."
>
>- Press Release, cssd.ac.uk

Remarks on this will be brief, as the project does not directly concern previsualisation, but it does shed light on the many institutions concerned spatial technology, beyond just stage design and lighting, and towards performance capture of actors, and immersive audio- by the look of the institutions involved.

XR Network+ also boasts a background of virtual production R&D grants with RSC.

## What we can see happening

This project shows a recent, large cooperation effort of major institutions into XR research. This particular project is concerned with hybrid digital/physical theatre performances, and rehearsing/spectating these using performance capture. FNO's XR Stage has also evidenced research into performance capture[^1].

Institutions involved are connected particularly to advancements in acoustics and immersive, spatial audio.
