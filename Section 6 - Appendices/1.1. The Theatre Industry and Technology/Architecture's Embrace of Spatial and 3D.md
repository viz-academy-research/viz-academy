 The main article suggests that theatre, as an inherently spatial medium, might drive demand for bespoke spatial computing tools, drawing a parallel with the architecture industry's adoption pathway. This appendix provides context on how architecture has leveraged 3D digital workflows and immersive technologies.

## Architecture's Journey into 3D and Immersive Tech

The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector underwent a significant digital transformation before many others:

 * **From 2D CAD to 3D BIM:** While 2D CAD replaced manual drafting, the shift towards 3D modeling and particularly **Building Information Modeling (BIM)** was transformative. BIM involves creating intelligent 3D models containing rich data about building components, enabling better coordination, clash detection, simulation, and documentation across the project lifecycle[^1][^2].

 * **Drivers for Adoption:** The complexity of large building projects, the need for precise coordination between multiple disciplines (structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing), regulatory requirements, and the significant costs associated with errors discovered late in construction strongly incentivized the adoption of 3D/BIM workflows[^1]. The long lead times for design and construction also make robust early visualization crucial.

 * **Leveraging Spatial Computing (VR/AR):** Building on 3D models, the AEC industry became an early adopter of VR and AR for specific use cases:

     * **Design Review:** Immersive walkthroughs in VR allow architects, engineers, and clients to experience and evaluate spaces at true scale before construction begins, identifying design issues or opportunities missed on screen[^3][^4].
     * **Client Communication:** VR/AR provides powerful tools for presenting designs to clients, helping them understand spatial qualities and make informed decisions more easily than with traditional drawings or renders[^3].
     * **Virtual Mock-ups:** Creating virtual prototypes of complex spaces (e.g., operating rooms, factory floors) allows for user testing and workflow simulation without costly physical mock-ups[^4].
     * **On-site AR:** Augmented Reality applications can overlay BIM data onto the physical construction site via tablets or headsets, aiding verification, installation guidance, and progress tracking[^1].


## Parallels and Potential for Theatre

 Architecture's experience provides valuable context:

 * **Shared Spatial Nature:** Both fields grapple with designing complex three-dimensional environments and communicating those designs effectively to collaborators and stakeholders.

 * **Value of Early Visualization:** The ability to "inhabit" and review a design spatially before committing physical resources is highly valuable in both fields for catching errors and refining the vision.

 * **Industry-Specific Needs:** While theatre can leverage tools developed for AEC or gaming (like VR headsets or game engines), its unique requirements – emphasis on lighting and atmosphere, integration of dynamic performance elements, rapid production timelines, specific collaborative structures – differ significantly. Theatre already uses some bespoke digital tools (e.g., lighting previsualization software[^5][^6]). Just as architecture's specific needs drove the development of BIM and tailored VR/AR applications, it's plausible that increasing adoption of spatial computing in theatre could eventually lead to demand for tools more finely tuned to its unique collaborative and creative processes.

 Architecture demonstrates how a complex, spatial design industry integrates immersive digital tools because they offer tangible benefits for visualization, collaboration, and problem-solving within their specific context. This precedent supports the idea that theatre, facing its own spatial challenges, might similarly find value and potentially drive the development of tools suited to its distinct needs.
