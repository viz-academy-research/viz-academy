The main article introduces **Spatial Computing** – technologies enabling real-time, interactive, three-dimensional digital experiences – contrasting its capabilities with the historical limitations of pre-rendered 2D media[^1]. This appendix provides brief context on these technologies and their potential relevance for inherently spatial art forms like theatre, informed by industry practices and ongoing research[^2].

## What is Spatial Computing?

Spatial Computing encompasses a range of technologies (including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality) that allow users and computers to interact with digital information within a three-dimensional context[^3][^4]. Key aspects include:

 * **Real-Time 3D:** Driven by powerful GPUs and real-time rendering engines (like Unreal Engine or Unity), complex 3D scenes (often built using polygonal modeling techniques[^2]) can now be generated and manipulated interactively on accessible hardware[^5][^6].
 * **Immersion & Presence (VR):** Virtual Reality headsets aim to create a sense of "presence" – the feeling of actually *being* within a simulated 3D environment – allowing intuitive understanding of scale and spatial relationships[^7].
 * **Blending Digital & Physical (AR/MR):** Augmented and Mixed Reality overlay digital graphics onto the real world or allow digital objects to interact with physical space, offering new ways to contextualize information[^3].


## Potential Relevance for Spatial Arts

 While theatre's end product is live and physical, the *process* of creating it involves designing and planning within three-dimensional space. Spatial computing technologies offer potential tools better suited to this than traditional 2D methods:

 * **Visualizing the Unbuilt:** Experiencing proposed set or lighting designs 'immersively' in VR can provide insights into scale, atmosphere, and crucially, **sightlines** from multiple audience perspectives, overcoming limitations inherent in assessing complex 3D spaces on flat screens[^2][^8].
 * **Enhanced Collaboration & Communication:** Shared virtual environments offer possibilities for remote teams to review designs, discuss spatial arrangements, or conduct virtual walkthroughs together, potentially improving on screen-sharing static 3D models[^8].
 * **Simulation & Problem Solving:** The ability to simulate aspects of a production virtually (e.g., basic lighting states, scenic movements) allows for early identification and potential resolution of spatial or technical issues before physical resources are committed[^9].

## Future Trajectory & Considerations

 Spatial computing is a rapidly evolving field. While its integration into standard theatre workflows faces practical considerations like time constraints, cost, technical expertise, and the need for simplified workflows[^2]:

 * **Increasing Capability:** The underlying technologies (hardware, software engines, distribution methods like Pixel Streaming or standalone executables[^2]) are constantly improving, becoming more powerful and potentially more accessible[^10][^11].
 * **Specific Advantages:** The unique benefit of VR for tasks like accurate sightline reviews from any seat in a virtual auditorium presents a compelling use case specifically relevant to theatre production[^2].
 * **Strategic Attention Warranted:** Given the alignment between these immersive, interactive 3D tools and the fundamentally spatial nature of theatre creation, their continued development warrants serious attention for future planning and potential process optimization.
