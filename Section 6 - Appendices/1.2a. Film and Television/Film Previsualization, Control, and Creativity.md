## Has film gone too far?

The rise of sophisticated digital previsualization (previs) has undeniably revolutionized filmmaking, particularly in large-scale, VFX-heavy productions. As detailed in the main text, previs allows for meticulous planning, potentially saving time and resources while enabling complex visual sequences previously unimaginable. However, this increasing reliance on detailed digital blueprints raises critical questions, especially pertinent for theatre practitioners observing trends in adjacent creative industries: Does extensive previs enhance or constrain creativity? What is the impact on directors and actors? And has the pursuit of technological precision inadvertently narrowed the scope of mainstream filmmaking? This appendix delves deeper into these concerns, acting as further reading on the potential pitfalls and complexities surrounding modern film production workflows.

## **The Marvel Model: Precision and Prescription**

Marvel Studios stands as a prominent example of deep previs integration. For a film like *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), visualization studios like The Third Floor generated thousands of previs shots (over 7,300, evolving into postvis), mapping out nearly every moment, from grand battles to intimate character interactions, often years before principal photography began and sometimes before scripts were finalized [^1, ^2]. Supervisors like The Third Floor's Gerardo Ramirez, a veteran of numerous Marvel projects, played significant roles, sometimes described as akin to directing or editing these sequences in their virtual form [^1, ^3].

This meticulous planning offers clear production advantages – coordinating complex VFX, ensuring technical feasibility (using detailed 'techvis'), and reducing costly reshoots [^1]. However, it has also fueled debate about directorial authorship. Concerns have been voiced that in such heavily pre-planned pipelines, the director's role might shift towards execution rather than origination, particularly for complex action sequences largely determined in previs. Argentine director Lucrecia Martel famously recounted being told during discussions for *Black Widow* not to worry about the action scenes as they would be handled, implying key creative decisions were already locked [^4]. While other directors like Chloé Zhao have emphasized their collaborative involvement in the previs for films like *Eternals*, countering the notion that directors lack input on action scenes [^5], the perception persists that the process can sometimes lead to directors feeling creatively "on rails." The sheer scale and financial stakes involved may incentivize studios to minimize on-set variables through extensive pre-planning, potentially standardizing visual approaches.

## **The Actor's Experience: Isolation in the Digital Void**

Beyond directorial control, the increasing prevalence of green/blue screen technology and digital characters – often facilitated by previs – profoundly impacts the actor's process. Sir Ian McKellen's reported distress during the filming of *The Hobbit* trilogy serves as a poignant example. Required to act largely alone against green screens, reacting to tennis balls or earpiece prompts instead of fellow actors present in the same space (due to scale differences being handled digitally), he reportedly questioned whether he could continue under such isolating conditions [^6].

While technology like performance capture allows actors like Andy Serkis to deliver nuanced performances through digital characters [^7], McKellen's experience highlights a potential downside: the removal of immediate human connection and tangible environment can be deeply alienating for performers trained in responsive, collaborative traditions, potentially impacting the authenticity or depth of the performance captured [^8]. Does the logistical or budgetary efficiency gained risk sacrificing the intangible magic – the "spark" – that arises from actors directly interacting in a shared space? Modern techniques like volumetric capture aim to preserve more of the raw performance [^9], but the challenge of mediating performance through layers of technology remains.

## **Automation Anxiety: AI and the Creative Future**

The anxieties surrounding technology's role extend beyond previs and green screen. The 2023 Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike highlighted deep concerns about the potential use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in screenwriting – not just as a research tool, but potentially to generate scripts, undermine writers' compensation, or exploit existing work for training AI models without permission [^10]. Similar concerns exist within the acting community regarding AI-generated performances or the use of digital doubles created with AI, raising ethical questions about consent, likeness rights, and the future value of human performers [^11, ^9]. These broader industry anxieties reflect a fear that technology, pushed for efficiency or novelty, could devalue human creativity and craft across various roles.

## **Genre Homogenization and Audience Fatigue?**

Could the very efficiency of tech-heavy pipelines, including previs, inadvertently favour certain types of filmmaking? The meticulous planning enabled by digital tools arguably lends itself best to genres reliant on complex action, VFX, and predictable structures – namely, the franchise blockbusters that dominate multiplexes. Concurrently, observers note the decline of the "mid-budget" film – dramas, comedies, rom-coms – which often rely more on character, dialogue, performance nuances, and less on visual spectacle [^12]. Is there a correlation? Does the industrial efficiency of previs pipelines make studios more risk- averse, favouring easily plannable, effects-driven tentpoles over character-focused stories with less obvious previs requirements, stories whose enduring appeal often lies in their human connection and relatable imperfections (consider the perennial rewatching of classic rom-coms)? This potential narrowing of mainstream output might also connect to whispers of "superhero fatigue," where visual precision repeated across numerous entries could lead to aesthetic sameness.

Furthermore, one must question the universal applicability of total previsualization. Could epic films defined by their challenging locations, logistical hurdles, and emergent on-set discoveries – like *Lawrence of Arabia* or *Apocalypse Now* – even be meaningfully previsualized in their entirety without losing the very essence derived from their unpredictable creation process [^13]? As the adage goes, "the map is not the territory." Perhaps the limitations of earlier filmmaking tools forced a closer connection to the unpredictable realities of production, fostering a different kind of creative problem-solving. The ability to conjure near-perfect visuals early in the process might risk dazzling creatives into complacency, potentially dimming inspiration if not wielded thoughtfully.

## **Theatre's Relative Insulation?**

Theatre, by its intrinsic nature, seems somewhat insulated from the most extreme versions of these specific issues. The fundamental requirement for live actors performing for a live audience each night creates fewer perceived "shortcuts" to the final product. The collaborative energy of the rehearsal room, the direct interaction between performers, and the tangible presence of the set remain central. While digital tools are increasingly integrated, the core liveness arguably provides a bulwark against the complete pre-determination or digital replacement seen as potential risks in screen media. The thriving existence of amateur and youth theatre also underscores a foundational engagement with performance less dependent on industrial-scale technology.

## **Conclusion: Balancing Vision and Control**

The power of previsualization and related digital technologies in film and television is undeniable, enabling incredible feats of visual storytelling. However, the examples and anxieties discussed suggest potential downsides when these tools drive the process rather than serve the artistic vision. An overemphasis on control and predictability might sideline key creative voices, alienate performers, homogenize genre output, and ultimately fail to connect with audiences seeking authentic human experience. As theatre continues to explore and integrate digital tools, the cautionary tales from Hollywood offer valuable perspective: technology is most powerful when it enhances collaboration and empowers vision, not when it dictates terms or diminishes the irreplaceable spark of human creativity. The challenge, across all creative industries, remains finding the balance between leveraging powerful planning tools and preserving the space for discovery, spontaneity, and authentic performance.
