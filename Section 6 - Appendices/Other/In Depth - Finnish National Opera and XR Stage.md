## 3. The Role of XR Stage and Varjo in the Production Process of Turandot

The production of Giacomo Puccini's Turandot at the Finnish National Opera and Ballet marked a significant milestone in the application of extended reality technology in opera.[^6] The creative teams involved in this ambitious production extensively utilized the in-house developed XR Stage tool, which was built upon the robust framework of the Unreal Engine.[^6] Unreal Engine, a powerful real-time 3D creation tool, is widely adopted in the gaming industry and increasingly in virtual production for its ability to generate high-fidelity graphics and interactive environments. Using XR Stage within this engine, the FNOB's technical staff undertook the task of creating a photorealistic 3D model, or digital twin, of the opera house's main stage from the ground up.[^6] This meticulously crafted virtual replica mirrored the precise dimensions and visual characteristics of the actual physical stage, effectively establishing an immersive 3D environment where the entire production could be visualized and experienced before any physical sets were even constructed.[^6] This capability allowed the creative teams to conduct virtual site visits and iteratively refine their design choices within this highly accurate digital representation.[^9]

The XR Stage tool, in conjunction with the Unreal Engine, provided a versatile platform for various pre-production activities. It enabled the teams to display and experiment with lighting designs and projection mappings within the virtual environment.[^7] This feature proved invaluable, allowing a lighting technician, for instance, to develop the entire lighting scheme in the virtual world and test a wide array of light colors and setups.[^10] Furthermore, the tool facilitated the simulation of stage equipment operation, allowing the technical teams to virtually rehearse the mechanics of the production.[^7] The 3D model of the main stage, which served as the foundation for this virtual environment, was initially created by ZOAN, a Finnish studio specializing in digital visualization.[^7] The immersive nature of XR Stage allowed artists and technicians to move freely within the virtual space, whether positioned in front of the stage, on the stage itself, or even in the backstage areas.[^7] This unrestricted access to the virtual stage provided unlimited stage time for performers to familiarize themselves with the set layout and for the teams to test key sequences of the production.[^7]

The utilization of XR Stage and Varjo's XR technology during the pre-production phase of Turandot yielded significant benefits. One of the most notable was the seamless collaboration it enabled between the FNOB's team in Helsinki and the Malmö Opera in Sweden, which served as a co-producer for the opera.6 This virtual collaboration proved so effective that it eliminated the need for at least three international work trips between the two locations.[^6] This reduction in travel resulted in tangible monetary savings and also contributed to environmental sustainability by minimizing air travel. Moreover, the adoption of the XR stage approach led to substantial savings in both material and labor costs compared to traditional stage design and production methodologies.[^6] Approximately 20% of the originally budgeted labor costs were eliminated, translating to a remarkable 1,500 hours being cut from the overall production schedule.[^6] The total cost savings directly attributed to the use of the XR stage tool in the Turandot production amounted to approximately € 75,000.[^6] Beyond the economic advantages, the immersive VR environment provided by Varjo's technology also enhanced workplace safety.[^6] The creative team could practice safety procedures and visualize emergency exits within the virtual stage, allowing individuals in charge of safety to rehearse movements and evacuation plans early in the production process without requiring expensive real stage time and the involvement of a large crew.[^6]

## 4. Impact on Early Decision-Making in Turandot and Other Productions

The integration of XR technology through XR Stage and Varjo headsets had a profound impact on the early decision-making processes for the Turandot production. One of the primary benefits was the ability for the creative teams to gain crucial insights into the set design at a very early stage.[^7] By immersing themselves in the photorealistic virtual environment, the creative team could experience their artistic vision as if they were physically present within the actual stage setting, long before any physical construction commenced.[^6] This early exposure to the virtual stage allowed for a more informed and collaborative approach to the design process. Furthermore, the capability to display lighting and projections within the virtual environment [^7] enabled the lighting designer to experiment with different concepts and make critical decisions about the overall visual atmosphere of the production well in advance. For instance, the lighting technician could develop the lighting plot and test various colors and intensities in the virtual space[^10], leading to more refined and effective lighting choices for the final production.

Beyond visual design, the XR technology also facilitated the simulation of stage equipment operation.[^7] This capability allowed the technical teams to virtually test the functionality and coordination of stage machinery, such as moving platforms or flying elements, early in the production timeline. By identifying and resolving potential technical challenges in the virtual realm, the teams could mitigate risks and ensure a smoother execution during the physical build and performances. Moreover, the unlimited stage time offered by the virtual environment allowed performers to familiarize themselves with the set layout and practice their blocking for key sequences.[^7] This early exposure to the virtual stage, even when the physical space was unavailable, enabled performers to arrive on stage with a better understanding of the performance space, potentially leading to more efficient and productive rehearsals.[^11]

The use of XR technology fundamentally altered the production timeline by enabling essential decisions to be made much earlier. The fact that the virtual set accurately mirrored the actual production before any physical sets were built 6 meant that critical design and logistical decisions could be informed by a realistic visualization from the outset. This early previsualization[^12] allowed for more informed decisions on set design and manufacturing.[^6] The ability to iterate on design choices within the virtual environment[^9] facilitated adjustments and refinements before the commitment of resources to physical construction. This proactive approach reduced the need for costly rework and ensured cleaner takes during the build process, ultimately eliminating additional expenses. This aligns with the broader benefits of previsualization in avoiding costly reshoots and delays that can arise from late-stage design changes. While the provided research material primarily focuses on the impact of XR technology on Turandot, it is noted that the FNOB has utilized VR and AR for a total of seven productions since 2020.7 Although specific details on the impact on early decision-making for these other productions are not provided in the snippets, the continued adoption of the technology strongly suggests that it has provided ongoing benefits in streamlining the decision-making processes across multiple operas and ballets.

## 5. Benefits and Challenges of XR Technology Adoption at the Finnish National Opera

The adoption of XR technology at the Finnish National Opera has yielded a multitude of documented benefits, significantly impacting various aspects of their production process. One of the most notable advantages has been the reduction in travel time and associated costs.[^6] By enabling seamless remote collaboration between the FNOB's team in Helsinki and the co-producing Malmö Opera in Sweden, the need for frequent international work trips was minimized, resulting in both financial and logistical efficiencies. Furthermore, the FNOB experienced significant savings in both material and labor costs.[^6] For the Turandot production, the implementation of XR Stage led to an approximate 20% reduction in budgeted labor costs, which translated to an impressive 1,500 hours being cut from the production schedule. The total cost savings directly attributed to the use of the XR technology in this single production amounted to around € 75,000.6

Beyond the economic advantages, the adoption of XR technology has also enhanced workplace safety within the FNOB.[^6] The immersive virtual environment allows creative and technical teams to practice safety procedures and visualize emergency exits in a risk-free setting. This capability enables individuals responsible for safety to rehearse movements and evacuation plans early in the production process, contributing to a safer working environment for all involved. The shared immersive environment provided by Varjo's technology also fostered improved collaboration among international teams.[^6] The ability to experience the virtual stage together, regardless of geographical location, streamlined communication and facilitated a more unified approach to the production. The design process itself was streamlined through the use of XR Stage[^8], which facilitated communication, improved overall efficiency, and reduced the reliance on traditional, time-consuming methods like physical scale models. The virtual environment offered unlimited stage time for testing and rehearsals[^7] without the constraints of physical set construction or stage availability. This allowed for extensive experimentation and refinement of designs and choreography. Finally, the early visualization and testing capabilities of XR Stage contributed to reduced waste through the creation of more accurate plans and a decrease in the need for physical rework.[^8]

While the research material predominantly highlights the positive outcomes of XR technology adoption at the FNOB, one article does mention that the artists involved were only receptive to using virtual tools if the models exhibited photorealism and the user experience was intuitive.6 This suggests that achieving a high level of visual fidelity and ensuring ease of use were critical factors for the successful integration of XR technology within the opera's artistic and technical workflows.
