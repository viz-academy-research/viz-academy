## Comprehensive Analysis of the Theatre Operation and Comms Ecosystem

### Ecosystem Overview

The theatre operation and comms ecosystem comprises software, hardware, and traditional practices that ensure smooth execution of live performances. Key components include:

- **Cue Playback Software**: QLab and alternatives manage sound, video, and lighting cues.
- **Prompt Books**: Traditional methods for tracking cues and blocking, maintained by the stage manager.
- **Headset Comms Systems**: Tools like ClearCom and TecPro facilitate real-time communication.
- **Stage Management Desks**: Centralized hubs for cue calling, paging, and monitoring during performances.
- **Cue Lights**: Visual indicators for operators and actors, often used alongside headsets.

This ecosystem supports theatre operations from technical rehearsals (tech) to performance runs, ensuring all departments are synchronized.

### QLab and Alternatives

- **QLab**: A macOS-based software for sound, video, and lighting control, widely used in theatre for its flexibility and reliability. QLab 5 (as of 2025) supports multiple users in a single workspace, allowing collaborative editing during tech. It offers extensive features like matrix-based audio routing, OSC/MIDI/timecode support, and timeline mode for adjusting cue timings. It’s used in productions like _The Book of Mormon_ on Broadway for managing complex soundscapes.
- **Show Cue System (SCS)**: A Windows-based alternative, SCS focuses on audio and video playback with a straightforward interface. It supports multi-channel audio and MIDI control, making it suitable for smaller theatres or those on a budget.
- **MultiPlay**: Another alternative, MultiPlay is a lightweight, free software for audio and video playback, often used in community theatres. It lacks advanced features like QLab’s projection mapping but is accessible for basic cueing needs.
- **Resolume**: Primarily a VJ software, Resolume is sometimes adapted for theatre to handle video playback and projection mapping, offering a middle ground for mid-sized productions needing more than QLab but less than high-end media servers.

### Traditional Book Marking Methods

Traditional book marking, centered on the **prompt book**, remains a cornerstone of stage management:

- **Prompt Book**: A binder containing the script, annotated with all cues (lighting, sound, set changes), blocking, and notes. The Deputy Stage Manager (DSM) uses it to call the show, marking cues with numbers (e.g., “LX Q 11” for lighting cue 11) and actions (e.g., “Actor enters SL” for stage left). The book is prepared during rehearsals, often with pencil for easy updates, and includes tabs for quick reference during runs.
- **Marking Techniques**: Cues are written in the margins, often color-coded (e.g., blue for lighting, red for sound), with “Standby” and “Go” points clearly marked. Blocking is noted using shorthand (e.g., “X DS” for cross downstage). This method, dating back to the 19th century, ensures consistency across performances, especially in repertory theatres where multiple shows run concurrently.
- **Historical Context**: The prompt book evolved from early theatre practices where a “prompter” would whisper lines to actors. By the 20th century, it became the stage manager’s tool for orchestrating the entire production, a practice formalized by companies like the Gaiety Theatre in Manchester (founded 1908).

### Typical Commercial Use of Headset-Based Comms

Headset-based communications are standard in commercial theatre for real-time coordination:

- **Systems Used**: ClearCom (common in the US) and TecPro (popular in the UK) are the leading systems. These include beltpacks, headsets, and main stations, often located at the stage manager’s desk or in the booth. Systems support multiple channels, allowing sub-groups (e.g., lighting, sound) to communicate separately.
- **Setup and Use**: During tech and runs, the stage manager (SM) uses the headset to give cues (e.g., “Standby LX Q 11”) and coordinate with crew. Operators respond (e.g., “Standing By”) to confirm readiness. Headsets are wired for reliability, though wireless options like Eartec UltraLITE are used in smaller venues.
- **Commercial Context**: In West End and Broadway productions, such as _Hamilton_, ClearCom systems are used to manage over 100 cues per act, ensuring precise timing across departments. Main stations control multiple channels, allowing the SM to communicate with all teams or isolate specific groups (e.g., “Electrics on cans”).

### Common Calls Between SMs and Staff

The following calls, used between stage managers and staff, have specific meanings and historical origins:

- **“Standby LX Q 11”**: Indicates that lighting cue 11 is imminent. The operator responds, “Standing By,” confirming readiness. “LX” (short for electrics) dates to early 20th-century theatre when lighting was managed by the electrics department.
- **“LX Q 11 Go”**: The command to execute the cue. “Go” is the universal trigger word, established in the 1920s to avoid ambiguity (e.g., “Fade” or “Stop” are not used). The operator may respond “Running” for long fades.
- **“Quiet on Cans”**: A directive to minimize chatter on headsets, ensuring clear communication during critical moments. “Cans” refers to headsets, a term from the 1930s when tin cans connected by string were used for basic communication.
- **“We Have Front of House Clearance”**: Announced by the Front of House Manager to the SM, indicating the audience is seated and the show can start. This practice began in the 1950s with the rise of formal audience management.
- **“Beginners to the Stage”**: Called five minutes before curtain, summoning actors who appear first (known as “beginners”). This tradition dates to the 18th century, when actors were called to their opening positions.
- **“Curtain in Fifteen”**: Used in some US venues to indicate 15 minutes until the show starts, a variation of the UK’s “Half Hour Call” (given 35 minutes before curtain).

These calls originated in early theatre when communication relied on verbal signals due to limited technology. The standardization of “Standby” and “Go” emerged in the 1920s as technical complexity grew, ensuring clarity across departments.

### Comprehensive Tools for Theatre Play Operation and Comms

The following tools are used during tech (technical rehearsals) and run (performance) phases:

- **Stage Management Desk (Prompt Desk)**: Located downstage left in the prompt corner, the desk is the SM’s command center. It includes:
    - Cue light switches (red for standby, green for go) for visual cues.
    - Paging controls for front-of-house (FOH) and rear-of-house (ROH) announcements.
    - Headset comms system for verbal cues.
    - Clock for timing calls (e.g., “Half Hour Call” at 35 minutes before curtain).
    - Monitors for stage visibility.  
        Modern desks, like those at the National Theatre, use digital interfaces for cue sequencing.
- **Cue Lights**: Visual indicators for operators and actors, used alongside headsets. Systems like Softcue by Howard Eaton Lighting allow preset sequences, improving reliability during runs.
- **Intercom Systems**: ClearCom and TecPro provide wired and wireless options. Main stations at the SM desk control multiple channels, ensuring efficient communication during tech and runs.
- **QLab and Alternatives**: QLab manages sound, video, and lighting cues, with features like timeline mode for adjusting timings and Cart mode for button-triggered cues. Alternatives like SCS and MultiPlay offer similar functionality for different budgets.
- **Prompt Book**: The SM’s manual record of all cues, blocking, and notes, used during tech to set cues and during runs to call the show.
- **Gaffer Tape**: Used for marking stage positions (e.g., spikes for actor placement) and securing cables. It’s a staple for tech setup, ensuring safety and precision.
- **God Mic**: A PA system for the director to communicate with the cast and crew during tech, especially in large venues, without shouting.

### Tech and Run Phases

- **Tech Rehearsals**: Focus on integrating technical elements. The SM calls cues (e.g., “Standby Sound Q 12”), operators respond, and adjustments are made. QLab runs sound and video cues, while the prompt book records changes. Headsets ensure real-time coordination, and cue lights provide visual confirmation.
- **Run (Performance)**: The SM calls the show from the prompt desk, using headsets to give cues (e.g., “LX Q 11 Go”) and cue lights for non-verbal signals. QLab executes pre-programmed cues, and the prompt book ensures consistency across performances.

### Present Market Position

QLab dominates the cue playback market due to its macOS integration and comprehensive features, used in major productions globally. ClearCom and TecPro lead in comms, with ClearCom prevalent in the US and TecPro in the UK.
