## USD, GLB, and Evolving 3D Standards

### Introduction

The 3D content creation landscape is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by advancements in extended reality (XR), artificial intelligence (AI), and collaborative workflows. Two modern file formats, GLB (part of glTF)[^1] and OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description, or USD)[^2], are at the forefront of this evolution, poised to redefine how 3D assets are created, shared, and delivered. 

This article explores the roles of GLB and USD, contextualizes them against historical formats like OBJ[^3] and Alembic[^4], and envisions a hypothetical "superstandard" abstraction layer that could unify these formats for next-generation AI-driven cloud applications. By charting their trajectories over the next decade, we assess whether GLB and USD will become the PNG and JPG of 3D[^5], their corporate backing, and their integration with emerging technologies.

### Overview of GLB and OpenUSD

#### GLB (Binary GL Transmission Format)[^1]

- **Definition**: GLB is the binary version of glTF (GL Transmission Format), a standard developed by the Khronos Group for efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models.
- **Purpose**: Optimized for real-time rendering in web, mobile, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) applications.
- **Key Features**:
    - Compact file size due to binary encoding.
    - Supports textures, animations, and Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials.
    - Single-file format, eliminating external dependencies.
    - Often referred to as the “JPEG of 3D” for its delivery efficiency[^5].
- **Use Cases**: Web-based 3D visualizations, mobile AR apps, gaming, and e-commerce product displays.

#### OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description)[^2]

- **Definition**: OpenUSD, or USD, is a framework for describing and composing complex 3D scenes, initially developed by Pixar and now managed by the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD)[^6].
- **Purpose**: Designed for interoperability, collaboration, and scene management in professional 3D workflows.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports hierarchical scene descriptions, layering, and composition.
    - Extensible via plugins for custom schemas and file formats.
    - Variants include .usda (ASCII), .usdc (binary), and .usdz (package format for AR).
- **Use Cases**: Film production, visual effects (VFX), animation, and industrial applications like automotive design.

### Comparison to PNG and JPG

GLB and USD are likely to coexist, serving distinct purposes akin to JPG and PNG in 2D imaging[^5]:

- **GLB**: Like JPG, it prioritizes efficiency for distribution, making it ideal for real-time delivery.
- **USD**: Like PNG, it preserves more data for editing and collaboration, suitable for professional workflows.

### Historical Context: OBJ and Alembic

#### OBJ (Wavefront Object)[^3]

- **Origin**: Developed in the 1980s by Wavefront Technologies for 3D geometry exchange.
- **Purpose**: A simple, text-based format for storing 3D geometry, including vertices, normals, and texture coordinates.
- **Key Features**:
    - Lightweight and human-readable (.obj files are ASCII).
    - Supports meshes, basic materials (via .mtl files), and UV mapping.
    - No support for animations, complex hierarchies, or advanced material systems.
- **Historical Role**:
    - Became a de facto standard for 3D model exchange due to its simplicity and wide tool support.
    - Used in gaming, animation, and 3D printing for static models.
- **Limitations**:
    - Lacks support for modern requirements like animations or PBR materials.
    - Large file sizes for complex models due to text-based encoding.

#### Alembic[^4]

- **Origin**: Introduced in 2009 by Sony Pictures Imageworks and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), later open-sourced in 2011.
- **Purpose**: Designed for efficient storage and interchange of animated geometry and complex scenes in film and VFX.
- **Key Features**:
    - Binary format optimized for large datasets.
    - Supports animated geometry, camera data, and point caches.
    - Non-destructive, allowing baked animation data to be shared without proprietary scene information.
- **Historical Role**:
    - Standardized data exchange in VFX pipelines, enabling collaboration between tools like Maya, Houdini, and Nuke.
    - Widely adopted in film and animation for transferring complex, time-varying geometry.
- **Limitations**:
    - Focused on geometry and animation, not full scene descriptions or real-time rendering.
    - Less suited for web or consumer applications due to file size and complexity.

### Future Outlook: Trajectories Over the Next Decade

#### OBJ

- **2025–2030**: Persists in legacy workflows, 3D printing, and education due to universal support. Gradually phased out in professional pipelines as GLB and USD dominate[^8].
- **2030–2035**: Relegated to niche roles, similar to BMP in 2D imaging. Conversion tools will allow OBJ assets to be imported into GLB or USD workflows.

#### Alembic

- **2025–2030**: Continues as a key format in VFX and animation for geometry and animation interchange. Faces competition from USD, particularly in pipelines adopting NVIDIA Omniverse[^6].
- **2030–2035**: Coexists with USD, focusing on specific use cases like point cache exchange where USD’s complexity is unnecessary.

#### GLB/glTF

- **2025–2030**: Solidifies as the standard for web, mobile, and AR/VR delivery, replacing OBJ in consumer applications. Enhanced features like advanced materials and animations keep it competitive[^1].
- **2030–2035**: Dominates consumer XR and gaming, supported by Khronos Group’s ecosystem. Conversion to/from USD streamlines its use in professional pipelines.

#### OpenUSD

- **2025–2030**: Becomes the de facto standard for professional 3D workflows, surpassing Alembic in film, VFX, and industrial design. Drives collaborative XR and AI workflows via platforms like Omniverse[^2].
- **2030–2035**: Expands into emerging industries like digital twins and autonomous vehicle simulation due to extensibility. Coexists with GLB, serving as the production format while GLB handles delivery.

### Integration with AI and XR Platforms

#### Historical Formats

- **OBJ**: Minimal role in AI/XR due to its simplicity. Used as a fallback for importing legacy assets.
- **Alembic**: Supports AI in VFX by transferring baked simulations but lacks flexibility for AI scene generation. Limited in XR, primarily for pre-rendered animations.

#### Modern Formats

- **GLB/glTF**: Essential for deploying AI-generated 3D content to consumer XR devices (e.g., AR glasses, VR headsets). Lightweight nature aligns with real-time XR performance needs[^1].
- **OpenUSD**: Ideal for AI-driven workflows like procedural content generation, digital twins, and simulation due to scene management capabilities. Powers collaborative XR platforms, enabling real-time editing across tools[^2].

### Conclusion

GLB and OpenUSD are poised to dominate the 3D file format landscape, succeeding historical formats like OBJ and Alembic. GLB, with its efficiency, will lead consumer-facing applications in web, mobile, and XR, while USD, with its extensibility, will drive professional workflows in film, VFX, and industrial design. OBJ will persist in niche roles like 3D printing, while Alembic will remain relevant in VFX but face competition from USD. The hypothetical superstandard abstraction layer offers a transformative vision, unifying GLB and USD through seamless conversion and AI-driven optimization, potentially setting a new standard for AI cloud applications. Together, these formats and concepts will shape the future of 3D content creation, delivering interoperability and innovation across XR and AI platforms.
